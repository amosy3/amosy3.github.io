I am a PhD student at Bar Ilan University, working at ChechikLab under the supervision of <a href="https://chechiklab.biu.ac.il/~gal/"> Prof. Gal Chechik</a> and <a href="https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~porately/"> Prof. Ely Porat </a> . My main research interests are generalization and adaptation to new distributions (domain adaptation, domain generalization, non-iid federated learning, zero-shot, etc.).

I hold a B.A. in Physics and Mathematics from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Tel Aviv University.
