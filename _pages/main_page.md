I lead a talented team of 30 researchers, driving forward our organizationâ€™s most ambitious endeavors.

I hold a B.A. in Physics and Mathematics from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 
an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Tel Aviv University, 
and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Bar Ilan University. 
My main research interests are generalization and adaptation to new distributions (domain adaptation, domain generalization, non-iid federated learning, zero-shot, etc.).
